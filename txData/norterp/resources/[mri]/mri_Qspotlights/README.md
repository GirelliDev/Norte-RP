## Requirements

- latest version of [ox_lib](https://github.com/overextended/ox_lib/releases/latest)

It is current setup to support ox_core. If you need this to support another framework then you will need to make changes yourself. The only place that uses framework dependent events is in `client/main.lua` on line `49`. You can replace that event handler with your own.
